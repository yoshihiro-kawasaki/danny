Columns 4 and 5:  diffusion energy and its uncertainty
Column 6: Type of surface
Column 7: Type of diffusion
Column 8: Recommendation
-> Number is the number of the reaction in the downloaded network.

-> Numbers of data is the number of data in the downloaded network when several values are present in KIDA. When a user selects a range of temperature and that several rate coefficients in KIDA can be in agreement with his/her search, all data will be included in the network. We then expect the user to choose one of the values. If the reactions are particularly important, we advise the user to contact KIDA to get advises. 
These reactions that are present more than once in the network are listed below. 

-> Recommendation is the recommendation given by experts in KIDA. 
1 means that there is no recommendation (experts have not looked at the data). 
2 means that the value has been validated by experts over the Trange
3 means that it is the recommended value over Trange.
